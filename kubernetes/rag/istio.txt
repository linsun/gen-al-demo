A service mesh is an infrastructure layer that gives applications capabilities like zero-trust security, observability, and advanced traffic management, without code changes. Istio is the most popular, powerful, and trusted service mesh. Founded by Google, IBM and Lyft in 2016, Istio is a graduated project in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation alongside projects like Kubernetes and Prometheus.

Istio ensures that cloud native and distributed systems are resilient, helping modern enterprises maintain their workloads across diverse platforms while staying connected and protected. It enables security and governance controls including mTLS encryption, policy management and access control, powers network features like canary deployments, A/B testing, load balancing, failure recovery, and adds observability of traffic across your estate.

Istio is not confined to the boundaries of a single cluster, network or runtime â€” services running on Kubernetes or VMs, multi-cloud, hybrid, or on-premises, can be included within a single mesh.

Extensible by design and supported by a broad ecosystem of contributors and partners, Istio offers packaged integrations and distributions for various use cases. You can install Istio independently or opt for managed support from commercial vendors providing Istio-based solutions.
